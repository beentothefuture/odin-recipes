    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These truffles are so easy to make and they fly off the plate. People will love them and beg you for the recipe. You can keep your secret that these yummy little truffles are just 4 ingredients and can be made in less than half an hour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pack of your favorite Oreos</li>
        <li>8 ounces of cream cheese</li>
        <li>12-16 ounces of baking chocolate</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush the Oreos into fine crumbs. Leave in the creamy filling, it should still crumb well. You can use a food processor or blender, or do like I do and place the Oreos in a ziplock bag and crush them with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Mix the oreo crumbs with the cream cheese.</li>
        <li>Roll the mixture into ~1 tablespoon balls and place them on a baking sheet with parchment/wax paper. Tip - If the mixture is too wet, you can refrigerate to make it easier to handle. Place the baking sheet in the freezer or refrigerator for 1 hour to solidify the Oreo balls.</li>
        <li>Melt the chocolate with the 1/2 teaspoon of oil. The oil makes the chocolate thinner and better for dipping. Dip each Oreo ball into the melted chocolate and then place on a cooking sheet with parchment/wax paper. If you have any extra melted chocolate, you can drizzle it on top of the Oreo truffles to make them look pretty.</li>
        <li>Chill the truffles to set. Optional Garnishes: Add contrasting chocolate drizzle, sprinkles, crushed oreo crumbs, sea salt, sugar, or chopped nuts to add a little extra flair!</li>
    </ol>
