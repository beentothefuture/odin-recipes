    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vinegar Taffy. When I first mention the name to people, I get a negative reaction as people imagine the taste of vinegar in a candy. In truth, it's one of the most delicious candies I've ever had, and most people who get past their first reaction and give it a try agree.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white distilled vinegar</li>
        <li>pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients except the butter in a pan and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Boil to hard ball stage (~250 degrees f)</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and add butter</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a platter</li>
        <li>Pour the taffy onto the platter and allow it to cool until you can handle it without burning your hands.</li>
        <li>Apply a thin layer of butter to your hands. Begin to pull the taffy until it is light in color and stiff (15-45 minutes).</li>
        <li>Roll it into a rope. Use the handle of a butter knife to break it into small 1" pieces. Lightly dust with powdered sugar. Wrap in waxed paper and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
